## Preface
*    1. Timing ECO
    ![image](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Sy5_RXw6C.png)
    [reference:How to ECO timing?](https://www.synopsys.com/content/dam/synopsys/implementation&signoff/white-papers/physical-aware-wp.pdf)
        In the timing ECO flow, or during hold/setup time optimization, additional cells may be inserted into the legalized placement. For example, to fix setup time, a clock buffer can be inserted into the clock path, while a hold buffer can be added to the data path to address hold time issues. Another method to optimize timing is through cell sizing. However, these optimization methods may result in illegal placement, causing overlaps between cells.


*    2. Power and Timing Optimization Using Multibit Flip-Flop
    [reference:2024 ICCAD Problem B](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1k2ssyOYBHmjz8so-EIq6IMcfIC33SLVx/view)
    ![image](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rJd3Rmvp0.png)
    Another optimization method in place-and-route EDA tools is Flip-Flop banking. By merging two 1-bit flip-flops into a 2-bit flip-flop, power consumption and area can be significantly improved. However, the total negative slack (TNS) should also be considered as a potential drawback.

    [reference:Graceful Register Clustering by Effective Mean Shift Algorithm for Power and Timing Balancing](https://waynelin567.github.io/files/meanshift.pdf)
    Flip-flop banking offers several advantages in electronic design automation tools, especially for place-and-route optimization:
        1. Reduced Power Consumption: By merging multiple 1-bit flip-flops into a single multi-bit flip-flop (e.g., 2-bit, 4-bit), the number of clock drivers and interconnections is reduced, which lowers dynamic power consumption.
        2. Smaller Area: A multi-bit flip-flop requires less silicon area compared to multiple single-bit flip-flops, reducing overall chip area and allowing more efficient use of space.
        3. Simplified Clock Distribution: Fewer clock trees are needed to drive multi-bit flip-flops, which can reduce clock skew and power dissipation.
**However, it’s essential to balance these benefits with potential drawbacks like increased total negative slack (TNS), which might require further timing optimization.**

## Introduction
As mentioned earlier, many optimization techniques can result in cell overlap, leading to illegal placement. Therefore, a fast algorithm is needed to perform local legalization rather than full-chip legalization and determine whether the optimization is feasible at that moment. Consequently, a quick API for the legalizer is necessary so that the optimizer can frequently check whether the optimization is easy to legalize.

For example:
![image](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/r1JOdUZRC.png)

## Problem Formulation


Given a legalized placement $P$ and a set of cells $C$ to be inserted into the placement, implement an efficient **local** legalizer that legalizes the cells in $C$ into $P$ one by one. The local legalizer should aim to:

- Maintain the legality of the placement after each insertion.
- Minimize the disturbance to the existing placement.
- Ensure efficient execution, particularly for large instances of $C$.

Focus on designing a method that prioritizes local adjustments during the legalization process.

For example:
![image](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rJSuLDb0C.png)


## Problem Objective
To avoid full-chip legalization using well-known algorithms like [Tetris Legalization [Hill, Patent 2002]](https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/0d/17/0f/8b9dbb9343b70f/US6370673.pdf) or [Abacus Legalization [Spindler et al., ISPD’08]](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/1353629.1353640), a special weighted cost function is implemented to evaluate the quality of your results.

Given a legalized placement $P$ and a set of cells $C$ to be inserted into the placement.
$$
cost = (\sum_{i=1}^{|C|} \alpha \cdot x_i) + \beta \cdot y
$$
where
$$
\left\{
    \begin{matrix}
        |C| &=& \ \ cardinality \ of \ set \ C \\
        \alpha &=& \ parameter1 \\
        x_i &=& \# \ cell \ move \ in \ P \\
        \beta &=& parameter2 \\
        y &=& \ total \ displacement \ from \ initial \ position (Manhatan Distance)\\
    \end{matrix}
\right.
$$

Given a legalized placement `P` and a set of cells `C` to be inserted into the placement, implement an efficient **local** legalizer that legalizes the cells in `C` into `P` one by one. Specifically:

- After legalizing each cell `cell_i` from `C`, it should be added to the placement `P`.
- The updated placement `P` after adding `cell_i` should maintain legality, i.e., `P <= P + cell_i`.
- The process should continue for each cell in `C` until all cells are legalized.

The goal is to minimize disturbance to the existing placement and ensure efficient execution, especially for large sets of cells in `C`.

## Input Format
Disclaimer: Most of the testcase will be modified from [2024 ICCAD Problem B](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1k2ssyOYBHmjz8so-EIq6IMcfIC33SLVx/view). Thanks for <font color="#563586">(Synopsys, Inc)</font> to release the benchmark.

In this section we will define each syntax for data input. Most of the syntaxes are the floating point numbers and we expect students to take care of the data range within <font color="ff3333">DBL_MAX</font>.

*    1. Weight factors of the cost metrixs: $\alpha$, $\beta$ values are given out as Alpha, Beta, respectively.

        ```syntax
        Syntax
            Alpha <alphaValue>
            Beta <betaValue>

        Example
            Alpha 100
            Beta 200
        ```

*    2. DieSize describes the dimension of the die, namely the placement area of the design.

        ```syntax
        Syntax
            DieSize <lowerLeftX> <lowerLeftY> <upperRightX> <upperRightY>

        Example
            DieSize 0 0 50 30
        ```
*    3. Cell attribute and legalized coordinate. For fix cell, you are not allowed to move when you try to legalize the placement later.

        ```syntax
        Syntax
            <cellName> <lowerLeftX> <lowerLeftY> <width> <height> <FIX/NOTFIX>

        Example
            FF_1_0 8 0 5 10 NOTFIX
            FF_1_1 14 0 5 10 NOTFIX
            FF_1_2 14 20 5 10 NOTFIX
            C4 10 10 5 10 FIX
        ```
        
*    4. Placement rows. The given row would start from (<startX>, <startY>) and has a <totalNumOfSites> of cell sites repetitively placed back-to-back in x direction. A cell site is a small rectangle defined in PlacementRows with a dimension of (<siteWidth>, <siteHeight>). The leftmost coordinate of the PlacementRows is <startX> and the rightmmost coordinate of the PlacementRow is <startX + siteWidth x totalNumOfSites>. This syntax defines the placement sites in the design. The height of PlacementRow is standard cell site height, and we will also give the site count, which means that the height of PlacementRow is the height of a cell site and the width of. Every cell should be placed on the PlacementRows, with its lower left corner aligning to the site grid of the PlacementRows.

Note that to simplify the problem, the siteWidth should always be 1 in this assignment. This means the minimum precision of the cell coordinates should be at least 1 unit in the placement.

    
![image](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/r17eVv4AC.png)
    Figure 4 in [2024 ICCAD Problem B](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1k2ssyOYBHmjz8so-EIq6IMcfIC33SLVx/view). An example to illustrate what placing on-site means. We define on-site as cells with their bottom-left corner aligning to the site grid given from the PlacementRows from the design data input. The 4 green cells on the left part of the figure are placed on-site as their bottom-left corners are aligning with the site grids of the  PlacementRows; the 5 red cells on the right side of the figure are not placed on-site as none of the cells have their bottom-left corner placed on the site grid.
    
```syntax
Syntax
    PlacementRows <startX> <startY> <siteWidth> <siteHeight> <totalNumOfSites>

Example
    PlacementRows 0 0 1 10 10
```

*    Example
        ```syntax
            Alpha 100
            Beta 200
            DieSize 0 0 50 30
            FF_1_0 8 0 5 10 NOTFIX
            FF_1_1 14 0 5 10 NOTFIX
            FF_1_2 14 20 5 10 NOTFIX
            C4 10 10 5 10 FIX
            PlacementRows 0 0 1 10 50
            PlacementRows 0 10 1 10 50
            PlacementRows 0 20 1 10 50
        ```

*    5. Optimize Step
    Finally, here is the optimizer output, which aims to merge multiple flip-flops into multi-bit flip-flops. Students are expected to remove the list of flip-flops to be banked in the legalized placement $P$, and add the new multi-bit flip-flop into the legalized placement $P$ without overlapping other cells, while also minimizing the given cost function.
        ```syntax
        Syntax
            Banking_Cell: <list of ff to bank> --> <merged ff name> <x> <y> <w> <h>
        Example
            Banking_Cell: FF_1_19425 FF_1_16134 --> FF_2_0 732360 634200 9180 4200
        ```

        Please note that the merged cell coordinates might not be legalized. Find a space to place them on the placement row without overlapping with other cells.

In conclusion, there are two files per testcase: the legalized placement information will be stored in the *.lg file, and the optimizer step will be stored in the *.opt file.

## Output Format
For each optimization step, please output the legalized cell for the given merged flip-flop (FF), as well as all the cells that were moved during the legalization of this merged FF.

```syntax
Syntax
    <merged ff x> <merged ff y>
    <num of moved cell>
    <cel1_name> <cell1_x> <cell1_y>
Example
    734500 634200
    2
    FF_1_0 725000 623000
    FF_1_1 742000 695000 
```
    
## Runtime Factor
Runtime limit is 30 minutes for each case in our server. The hidden cases will be in the same scale as public cases. We would like to introduce the runtime factor in this homework to encourage the ideas with faster turnaround-time.
    
$$
   runtime \ factor = 0.02 \cdot \log_2(\frac{elapse \ time \ of \ test \ binary}{median \ elapse \ time})
$$

$$
    runtime \ factor \ bounded=max(-0.1, min(0.1, runtime \ factor))
$$

$$
     Performance \ score = PR(\ Initial \ score \cdot (1+runtime \ factor \ bounded)  )
$$
    
## Program Requirements
Your program should be executed by:

```bash=
$./Legalizer *.lg *.opt *_post.lg
```
After program finish, we expect a *_post.lg to show all info required for each optimized step.
        
For example:
```bash=
$./Legalizer testcase1.lg testcase1.opt testcase1_post.lg
```

## Visualizer

In EDA-related projects, it is good practice to visualize your results. Some well-known methods for doing this include using Python libraries like `matplotlib` or `seaborn`, and tools such as `gnuplot`. Visualizing your data helps in identifying trends, verifying correctness, and presenting your findings clearly. We might release a binary tool for plotting in the future, depending on available time...

## Q&A
This is the placeholder to discuss with the students.

*    Q1: 
Attribute of placement row?

        :::spoiler
        To simplfy the problem, we can make below assumption on placement row:
        1. Placement rows should share same startX
        2. Placement row will align on same startX, and be continous in the same y coordinate.
        3. Placement row will share the same height, however, the height of the row might not be exactly the same as the cell(combinational/sequential) height. The multi-row height cell might be given in this problem.
        (This multi-row height cell is very popular in the foundry, which might have better PPA result without modify the logic of the cell!)
        :::

*    Q2:
Attribute of the cell in *.lg file
        :::spoiler
        The given cell in the lg file should gaurantee to be on site.
        :::

*    Q3:
Evaluator is not runnable in the given server.(FATAL: kernel too old, Abort)
        :::spoiler
        Solve this problem, please git pull to get the latest binary file of evaluator!
        :::
        
*    Q4:
Are the new banked FFs fixed in the subsequent optimization steps?
        :::spoiler
        No, they can be moved to make space for the new block! The cell with prefix FF_ can be moved, the cell with C_ can't be moved.
